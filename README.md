> This is a empty module that houses multiple submodules for Equinix Fabric Terraform usage.

### Modules

This repository consists in a collection of modules that will accelerate your adoption of Equinix Terraform for Fabric use cases.
Each module is fully independent and it is dedicated to be used as its own module. They are placed here for organization of
all of Fabric's use cases as well as efficient discovery and selection of the product offerings outside of the base Fabric
Data Sources and Resources.

Each module has:

* Terraform source code to be used as a module
* README.md file containing instructions and specific notes to work with the module

### Examples

Each example is a specific use case in Equinix Fabric that the specific sub-module can be used for. Each example has the following:

* Terraform code leveraging the module for a simple use case
* Example definition of .tfvars file
* README.md explaining multiple ways the example can be leveraged.
