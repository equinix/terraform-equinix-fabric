# Fabric Routing Aggregation SubModule

The Fabric Route Aggregation Module will create a Route Aggregation Policy, add Route Aggregation Rules to it,
and attach the Route Aggregation Policy to an existing Fabric Connection.

Please refer to the cloud-router-2-port-connection-with-route-aggregations example in this module's
registry for more details on how to leverage the submodule.
