# Fabric Cloud Router to Fabric Port Connection with Route Filters

This example shows how to leverage the [Fabric Cloud Router Route Filters Module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/equinix/fabric/equinix/latest/submodules/cloud-router-route-filters)
to add Route Filters to a Fabric Connection from a Fabric Cloud Router to Fabric Port.

It leverages the Equinix Terraform Provider, the Fabric Cloud Router Connection
Module, the Fabric Cloud Router Routing Protocols Module, and the Fabric Cloud Router Route Filters Module,
to setup the connection, routing protocols, and route filters based on the parameters you have
provided to this example; or based on the pattern you see used in this example it will allow
you to create a more specific use case for your own needs.

See example usage below for details on how to use this example.
