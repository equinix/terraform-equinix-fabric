# Fabric Stream Alert Rules

This example shows how to leverage the [Fabric Stream Module
](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/equinix/fabric/equinix/latest/submodules/streaming-observability)
to create a Fabric Stream Alert Rule.

We are creating stream alert rules using Equinix Terraform Provider, Fabric Stream Module and 
Port Connection Module based on the parameters you have provided to this example. 
We have added Fabric Stream Attachment resource for reference for the asset type used. Additionally, 
the patterns found in this example can be followed in your own custom Terraform configurations for more complex solutions.

See example usage below for details on how to use this example.
