# Fabric Cloud Router to Alibaba Service Profile Connection

This example shows how to leverage the [Fabric Cloud Router Connection Module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/equinix/fabric/equinix/latest/submodules/cloud-router-connection)
to create a Fabric Connection from a Fabric Cloud Router to Alibaba Service Profile.

It leverages the Equinix Terraform Provider, the Alibaba Terraform Provider, the Fabric Port Connection Module and Fabric Routing Protocols module to setup the connection based on the parameters you have provided to this example; or based on the pattern you see used in this example it will allow you to create a more specific use case for your own needs.

For complete Connection creation, the connection needs to be accepted on Alibaba portal. Please refer from step 3 of the [Port to ALibaba connection example](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/equinix/fabric/equinix/latest/examples/port-2-alibaba-connection-with-alicloud-terraform-integration)
