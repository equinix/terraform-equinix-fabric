# Fabric Port to Equinix Precision Time Connection + PTP Time Service Configuration

This example shows how to leverage the [Fabric Port Connection Module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/equinix/fabric/equinix/latest/submodules/port-connection)
to create a Fabric Connection from a Fabric Port to Fabric Equinix Precision Time PTP Service Profile.
It also creates an PTP Configured Time Service on top of the created connection.

It leverages the Equinix Terraform Provider, equinix_fabric_precision_time_service Terraform resource, and the Fabric Port Connection
Module to setup the connection based on the parameters you have provided to this example; or based on the pattern
you see used in this example it will allow you to create a more specific use case for your own needs.

See example usage below for details on how to use this example.
